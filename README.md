Notes here
1. qms - quant mage json files, as of rn they are copied into a python file in utils/utils/strategy.py due to reading errors
2. utils/indicators - quant mage indicator implementations
3. utils/utils - files for different purposes - dataUpdate updates data, strategy parsing reads the strategy in, preProcessor is the entry point (it will do data update, run the backtest, and write the charts)
